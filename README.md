## Final Work Report

#### What work is done

Developed a [script](script.ipynb) in python to programmatically move
activity documentation pages from the Sugar Labs wiki to Github and simultaneously help-activity.

- Documentation of 50+ activities, comprising of 136 pages were migrated.
  - [List of all migrated pages and associated PRs](migrated-pages-list-and-prs.md)
  - Every mentioned wiki-page have been redirected to its [help.sugarlabs.org](https://help.sugarlabs.org/en/) and GitHub counterpart.

- [READMEs](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=author%3Ardrsadhu+user%3Asugarlabs&ref=simplesearch) were added to all concerned repositories.


#### What's left to do

A subset of activities do not currently work with the latest Sugar, and thus their documentation pages are yet to be moved. Example: [godiard/help-activity/#47](https://github.com/godiard/help-activity/pull/47)
